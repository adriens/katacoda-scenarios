[SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple
Software Development Kits on most Unix based systems.

It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing,
switching, removing and listing Candidates.

Formerly known as [GVM the Groovy enVironment Manager](https://github.com/flofreud/gvm),
it was inspired by the very useful [RVM](https://rvm.io/) and
[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) tools, used at large by the
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) community.
