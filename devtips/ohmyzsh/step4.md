`Oh My Zsh!` comes with a fine tuned set of commands and alias

Take a look at the [reference Wiki](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Cheatsheet).

Let's play with some of them :

- `tabs`{{execute T3}} : create a new tab in the current directory (macOS - requires enabling access for assistive devices under System Preferences).
- `take`{{execute}} : create a new directory and change to it, will create intermediate directories as required
- `zsh_stats`{{execute}} : get a list of the top 20 commands and how many times they have been run 
- `omz update`{{execute}} : Upgrade Oh-my-zsh
